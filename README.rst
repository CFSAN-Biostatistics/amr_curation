AMR Curation 
--------------------------------------------

**Actively monitored by the CARD Curation Team.**

A number of databases and software tools exist for DNA sequence-based investigation of antimicrobial resistance (see: `Boolchandani, D'Souza, & Dantas. Sequencing-based methods and resources to study antimicrobial resistance. Nat Rev Genet 2019. <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0108-4>`_). We encourage research, software developers, and AMR data curators to use this repository to submit, discuss, resolve curation issues for CARD or any other participating databases. Anyone with a GitHub account can submit an issue; AMR software developers or database curators are welcome to join as participants to share files, data, & code with the repository (send request to card@mcmaster.ca).

If you are submitting a question or correction about AMR data in a particular database, please indicate the database in your submission.

If your question or issue is about software, please use the software's own repository or email address to report the problem.
