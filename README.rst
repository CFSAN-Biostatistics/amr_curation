AMR Curation 
--------------------------------------------

A public repository for collective curation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and mutations. Submit, discuss, resolve curation issues for CARD or any other participating database. 

**Actively monitored by the CARD Curation Team.**

A number of databases and software tools exist for DNA sequence-based investigation of antimicrobial resistance (see: `Boolchandani, D'Souza, &Dantas. Sequencing-based methods and resources to study antimicrobial resistance. Nat Rev Genet 2019 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0108-4>`_).
